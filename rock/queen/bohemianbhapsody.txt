Is this the real life?

Is this just fantasy?

Caught in a landslide

No escape from reality



Open your eyes

Look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy

I need no sympathy



Because I'm easy come, easy go

A little high, little low

Anyway the wind blows

Doesn't really matter to me

To me



Mama, just killed a man

Put a gun against his head

Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Mama, life had just begun

But now I've gone and thrown it all away



Mama, oh!

Didn't mean to make you cry

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Carry on, carry on

As if nothing really matters



Too late, my time has come

Sends shivers down my spine

Body's aching all the time

Goodbye everybody, I've got to go

Gotta leave you all behind

And face the truth



Mama, oh!

(Anyway the wind blows)

I don't want to die

But sometimes wish

I'd never been born at all



I see a little silhouette of a man

Scaramouche, Scaramouche

Will you do the Fandango?

Thunderbolt and lightning

Very, very frightening me



Galileo. Galileo

Galileo. Galileo

Galileo, Figaro

Magnifico!



I'm just a poor boy

And nobody loves me

He's just a poor boy

From a poor family

Spare him his life from this monstruosity



Easy come, easy go

Will you let me go?

Bismillah!

No, we will not let you go

(Let him go!)

Bismillah! We will not let you go

(Let him go!)

Bismillah! We will not let you go

(Let me go!)

Will not let you go

(Let me go!)

Never, never let you go

(Let me go!)



Never let me go, oh!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh mama mia, mama mia

Mama mia let me go

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me

For me, for me



So you think you can stone me

And spit in my eye

So you think you can love me

And leave me to die



Oh baby, can't do this to me baby

Just gotta get out

Just gotta get right outta here



Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah!



Nothing really matters

Anyone can see

Nothing really matters

Nothing really matters to me

(Anyway the wind blows)
