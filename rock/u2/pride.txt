One man come in the name of love

One man come and go

One man come here to justify

One man to overthrow



In the name of love

What more in the name of love?

In the name of love

What more in the name of love?



One man caught on a barbed wire fence

One man, he resist

One man washed on an empty beach

One man betrayed with a kiss



In the name of love

What more in the name of love?

In the name of love

What more in the name of love?



Nobody but you

Somebody lied to you (It's all right)

Somebody to you



Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

Mm-mm-mm-mmmm



Early morning, April four

Shot rings out in the Memphis sky

Free at last, they took your life

They could not take your pride



In the name of love

What more in the name of love?

In the name of love

What more in the name of love?

In the name of love (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

What more in the name of love? (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

In the name of love (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

What more in the name of love? (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)



(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mmmm (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mmmm (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
